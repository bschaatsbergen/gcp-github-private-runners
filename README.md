# Self-hosted GitHub Runners on GCP.

This repository contains reference code for deploying self-hosted GitHub Actions Runners on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Google Compute Engine (GCE) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

## Overview

GitHub Actions Runners allow you to run GitHub Actions workflows on your own infrastructure. This can be useful if you need to perform tasks that require access to resources that are not available in GitHub-hosted runners, or if you need to keep your code and data within your own network.

This repository provides examples of how to deploy self-hosted GitHub Actions Runners on GCP using GCE and GKE. Each example is located in a separate directory, and includes scripts and configuration files to deploy the runner(s) and connect them to your GitHub repository.
